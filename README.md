`visionrt` **- Zero-overhead real-time computer vision.**

Skip the overhead:
```python
from visionrt import Camera, Preprocessor
import visionrt

camera = Camera("/dev/video0")
model = visionrt.compile(model)

for frame in camera.stream():
    tensor = Preprocessor(frame)
    out = model(tensor)
```

So fast you can see your camera's true refresh rate:

The orange narrow peaks show `visionrt` is so deterministic that you can actually see the hardware. The bimodal distribution is the webcam itself, not software jitter.
